## 📝 Abstract

With advances in **wireless communication** and growing **spectrum scarcity**, Spectrum Access Systems (SASs) offer an opportunistic solution but face significant **security challenges**.

- 📍 **Location disclosure** and transmission details leak user privacy.
- 🎭 SAS is vulnerable to **spoofing attacks** by malicious users.
- 🚨 Database operations are prone to **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks**.
- ⚛️ Quantum computing amplifies these threats further.

## 🌐 What is QPADL?

**QPADL** is the **first post-quantum secure framework** that simultaneously ensures:

✅ **Privacy** — via SAS-tailored **Private Information Retrieval (PIR)**  
✅ **Anonymity** — via a **post-quantum variant of Tor**  
✅ **Location Verification** — through advanced **signature constructions**  
✅ **DoS Resilience** — using **client puzzles** + **rate-limiting techniques**

⚡ Designed for **large-scale spectrum access systems**, QPADL is **efficient, secure, and future-proof** against quantum threats.

## 🚀 Build Instructions
Each QPADL instantiation and puzzle generation module has its own dedicated folder inside the `src/` directory. 
Within these folders, you will find the corresponding **bash scripts** required to build and run the project.  

For QPDAL's `OOP` instantiation, we refer to the original
implementation of CIP-PIR available [here](https://github.com/encryptogroup/cip-pir.git).
